Another critical characteristic of the forklift is its instability. Choose the correct shock absorbers based on which end or ends of the vehicle you're working on. Keep in mind that some trucks use struts on the front and shock absorbers on the rear.</p>
<p>However, just like a stock vehicle, some components in a lift kit can wear out over time, most notably the shock absorbers Some lift kits include shocks that are radically different from the stock units, meaning that replacing those shocks isn't always as simple as just looking your vehicle up.
