While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>
<p>Orderpickers will be used in applications where pallet trucks, rolling ladders, and other piece-picking methods are traditionally used. Variable-reach (or telehandler) forklifts are used to lift pallets or other objects to heights using a telescoping arm.
