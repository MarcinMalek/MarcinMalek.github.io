The 2C5000 became the primary model in 2010 and had maintained its status as one of the premier forklift models ever since.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many lift kits and the companies that sell and install them, fail to educate consumers about the differences in their vehicle's handling that can impact safety behind the wheel.
