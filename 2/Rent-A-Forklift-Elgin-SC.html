<p>This practical training course is designed for existing fork lift truck operators who need to transfer their experience and skills towards the effective use of 4 Way Directional Reach trucks. Each Kit includes a set of "Load Leveling" Air springs specifically created to maximize load carrying capacity, ride quality, stability and overall braking control. As order pickers are mostly operated at elevated heights, it is important that operators are properly trained on maneuvering and safety of these trucks.</p>
<p>The maximum capacity of reach forklifts is generally around 5,000 pounds. The weight of the forklift's battery can also be used to provide stability to the truck, so any change in the type of battery for the forklift can lead to instability. The Hydraulic hand Pallet trucks can handle palletised load up to 2500 Kg in a single haul and a single operator can lift and move this weight effortlessly over short distances.</p>

These options are available on flexible, competitive priced monthly payment plans ensuring that each unique customer can structure a payment plan suitable to their budgetary needs and forklift fleet requirements.</p>

Drive and operate your rental equipment safely. Batteries prevent the emission of harmful fumes and are recommended for facilities in which employees are in close proximity to forklifts in operation, food-processing and healthcare sectors.</p>

With these batteries, you benefit from our 2Shifts1Charge guarantee, which is unrivalled in the logistics sector: Our electric counterbalance trucks can complete two consecutive shifts without the need for battery replacement or top-up charging.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The new Toyota high capacity reach forklifts are developed for intensive stacking applications focusing on productivity, reliability, ergonomics (controls, steering and seat adapted to the driver's needs) and most importantly safety.</p>
