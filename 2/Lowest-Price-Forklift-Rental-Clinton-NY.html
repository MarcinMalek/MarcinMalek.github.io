The latest family of low level order picking trucks from Toyota Material Handling is the BT Optio L-series. We're here to let you know what sets lifted trucks apart from other pickups on the road - it's more than just the style and the ride height.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>You can rent a forklift quicker than you can buy. Maximal rough terrain forklift is a tough, compact forklift with a two-wheel drive system. The process of transforming a regular truck into a lifted truck is going to take a lot of thought, a lot of parts, and some very specific equipment in order to do it safely, correctly, and legally — but the results can be pretty impressive.</p>
