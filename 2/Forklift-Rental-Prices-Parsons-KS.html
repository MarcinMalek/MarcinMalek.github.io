<p>Like the LHM230P, the BT Pro Lifter, LHT100 is designed to work with minimal starting force for increased productivity during horizontal transport and loading operations.

Powered pallet jacks, 4 also known as electric pallet trucks, walkies, single or double pallet jacks, or power jack, are motorized to allow lifting and moving of heavier and stacked pallets.</p>

Long-term maintenance and upkeep on these lifted trucks can be higher than standard models, so keep that in mind when considering your options. We are also engaged in selling Second Hand or Used Forklift. All types of dockboards should have a high friction surface, designed to prevent employees or trucks from slipping.</p>
