<p>BJ's Rentals, Inc.

Ohio Power Tool carries a vast selection of pumps - including dewatering, diaphragm, sewage, sump, and trash varieties - from top names in tool manufacturing ( Chicago Pneumatic , Greenlee , Multiquip , RIDGID , and Wheeler-Rex ). These water pumps also offer a few power options (air, electric, gas, hydraulic) with some even being submersible.</p>
<p>Unless you are very experienced and know what to look for when inspecting a forklift, have a qualified mechanic or knowledgeable operator carry out the inspection. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>
