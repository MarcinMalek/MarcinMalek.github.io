Our clients can avail from us a qualitative range of Hydraulic Pallet Truck. Lifted cars can be dangerous, especially if you're driving behind them. Keep all parts of your body inside the industrial lift truck when travelling; travel with the forks as low to the floor as possible; decrease speed around corners and sound the horn; and, travel in reverse when a load obstructs your vision.</p>
<p>These trucks are required for loading and unloading the materials and carrying it from one place to another.

Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>Great customer service, I highly recommend the team at Damoli Forklifts. Lift Capacity: 2000 lbs.
