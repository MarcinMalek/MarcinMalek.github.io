<p>Widely demanded by various industries like textile, chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and warehouse, we provideÂ ForkliftsÂ onÂ RentalÂ basis. The order picker's multi-function control handle incorporates a solid base for a secure grip, providing precise control of travel and lifting functions. Overhead Guard = A framework above the operator's head attached to a lift truck to protect an operator. Forklift rental is by far the most flexible and cost effective way to ensure your warehouse operation or distribution center is fully equipped during high volume periods, eliminating bottlenecks and productivity losses.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<h2>Forklift Trucks, Lift Trucks, Material Handling Equipment Mendota </h2>
<p>If you purchased a truck with a lift kit and you're not certain of its lift height, you'll need to measure the difference between the factory ride height (found in your truck's service manual) and its current ride height. In the 1940s, forklifts became even easier to use, thanks to batteries that drivers could recharge. Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>
<p>This is an extremely rare type of mast configuration and reduces the lifting capacity of the truck considerably.

The largest of the "core" line of cushion trucks, the 15,500 lb. truck has the largest counterweight and the largest lifting capacity.
