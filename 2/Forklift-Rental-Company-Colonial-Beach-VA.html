<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

<h2>Toyota Fork Truck Colonial Beach</h2>
<p>Forklifts are powered industrial trucks used to lift and move materials in short distances. Operators get excellent visibility with panoramic views of rack, loads and aisle. Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments and is popular for use in large distribution centers.</p>
<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.
