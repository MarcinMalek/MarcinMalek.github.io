<p>Ziglift Material Handling is committed to your material handling needs and is open to service our essential business customers.

<h2>Identifying All Important Forklift Parts in Sudbury </h2>
<p>For loads exceeding 2500kg, a motorized pallet jack, "walkie stacker" or Forklift is recommended.

A parking brake (or mechanism) which may be a part of, or include the service brake(s), shall be provided and be capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 10% grade, whichever is the lesser. The innovative 3-phase motors in our electric forklifts combine powerful performance with minimal consumption of power.</p>
