<p>Picking out the right lift kit height means you'll need to know a little bit more about how certain lift heights will affect your vehicle's performance and what they are generally used for.

Frequency of use and pallet transport distance should be taken into consideration when choosing between manual and electric pallet trucks.</p>
<p>Some of the conditions which may affect stability are, ground and floor conditions, grade, speed, loading (trucks equipped with attachments behave as partially loaded trucks even when operated without a load on the attachment), battery weight, dynamic and static forces, and the judgment exercised by the operator.
