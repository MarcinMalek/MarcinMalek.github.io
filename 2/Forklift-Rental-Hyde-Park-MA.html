<p>Scenario: You're in the market for a new forklift in Indianapolis You know specifically that you need an electric lift truck with cushion tires that can lift loads up to 4,500 lbs. In 2018, the Chinese market maintained rapid growth, with the fork sales outnumbering 500,000 units in the first ten months of 2018 and expectedly approaching 600,000 units throughout the year. Loop handle is spring loaded to return to upright position and eliminate bending to retrieve. Use our IC to Electric calculator to see what your potential cost savings could be by switching to electric forklifts.</p>
<p>These are Sit-down forklifts designed for indoor use with solid, cushioned tires — powered by internal-combustion (IC) engines that run on diesel fuel or, more commonly, LP gas.

Since they can easily move from indoor to exterior jobs, these machines are remarkably flexible.</p>
