<p>So while you may find cheaper custom trucks elsewhere, we doubt they'll compare to the quality you get from us. Granite industrial carries an inventory full of used Baker and Linde forklift truck parts. Most order picker forklifts have a 4-point suspension mechanism between the rear tires and the front wheels.

<p>All types of dockboards should be designed and maintained so the end edges will have a substantial contact with the dock (or loading platform) and the carrier to prevent the dockboard from rocking of sliding. The increased tire size and ground clearance makes off-roading increasingly possible by limiting the potential damage of debris, as well as providing an overall smoother ride across the rough ground.</p>
<p>Spinner knobs must not be attached to steering handwheels of trucks not originally equipped with such, without approval of of the safety department.

We carry a huge selection of lift trucks and forklifts for rent to provide a fit no matter the size or scope of your application. Now you've seen how a forklift's center of gravity can shift. So, the operator can drive straight in the aisle and turn the mast at a 90-degree angle to access the material.</p>
<p>It's not as easy to see vehicles around your lifted truck, especially if they're smaller passenger occupant vehicles or bikes. Like an articulated forklift, a pivoting-mast forklift can rotate its mast at a 90-degree angle to its body. That's why it's nice to rent a forklift when required.
