<p>Load and unload pallets on and off trucks. I used to say, If it has forks on it and you're lifting up pallets, it's covered by the forklift standard.” But that's not 100% true anymore. Raymond counterbalanced sit down forklift trucks can use specialized load handling attachments such as slip sheets, and carton clamps.
