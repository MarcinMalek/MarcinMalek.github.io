<p>There are many ways in which Linde is driving the development of its pallet trucks and pallet lift trucks forward. Rough terrain forklifts are designed for two things: lifting and moving loads. Unlike other forklifts, these material handling vehicles don't have cabs.

<p>These types of powered industrial trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and have pneumatic (air filled) tires. Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
