<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards.

For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>

Most standard forklifts can reach heights between 10 and 15 ft, but special forklifts like the telehandler can lift as high as 55 ft depending on the telehandler size you select.</p>

Better Equipment: In addition to freeing up capital , leasing a forklift usually results in getting better equipment than you could afford to buy.</p>
<p>These lifted trucks will get you to the next degree of efficiency and power. These prongs (forks) can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.

<p>This means your truck may not be as stable once the lift kit has been installed. Moreover, these forklifts are very flexible and they come with a range of attachments. While we offer the best lifted trucks for sale Indiana, we also offer lift kit installation in Chicago as well. This is where Freight Buddy comes in. With decades of experience in the shipping industry and warehouses in general, we know a thing or two about what to look for when it comes to buying a quality pallet jack.</p>
<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
