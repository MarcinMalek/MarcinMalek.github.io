<p>Order picker forklifts are usually powered by electric motors because they don't generate noxious fumes.

<p>A standard warehouse forklift measures between four and seven feet wide and eight to ten feet long.

Monster street truck drivers are at the distinct disadvantage in close quarters when maneuvering, such as in stop-and-go driving, city traffic, and even parking.

Reach forklifts can operate in aisles as narrow as 2.4 meters, as opposed to the counterbalance's minimum requirement of 3.7 meters.</p>
