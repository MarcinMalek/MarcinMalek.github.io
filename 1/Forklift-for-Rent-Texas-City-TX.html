<p>These Class 4 forklifts are one of the most commonly used forklifts in the U.S., typically used indoors for applications such as manufacturing, warehousing, bottling, and trucking. Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilizes a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level.</p>
<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg).

As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
