<p>Gas powered forklifts are more popular than their electric counterparts. Although they are versatile machines, you'll need the right size for the job. Our Rental Purchase Option (RPO) provides customers with an opportunity to acquire equipment by building equity over the rental period. When properly operated and maintained, a forklift is an invaluable piece of equipment.</p>
<p>For example, if what you are used to is an automatic car, test driving should not be the time for you to attempt driving a stick shift vehicle. The Toyota Order Picker easily maneuvers narrow aisles in warehouses with minimized rack impact during case picking thanks to optional wire guidance and double rail guidance systems. Industrial and powered pallet jacks in general weigh more than standard light-duty models.</p>
