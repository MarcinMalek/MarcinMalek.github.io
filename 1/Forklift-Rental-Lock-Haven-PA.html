<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>
<p>The rough terrain forklift dates back to about 1946 when a two-pronged lift attachment was placed on a power buggy or tractor chassis. Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components. Where typical fork lift trucks need to approach a load head on, on a flat even surface, an all-terrain or rough terrain forklift can pick up a load even when the load is on a slope or otherwise unusually positioned.</p>
