Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts.

<p>In terms of their use, apart from being very fast, counterbalanced forklifts are ideal for working both inside and outside the warehouse. The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install. If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down.</p>
<p>If you've followed all of this advice you should have a pretty good idea by now about what you should do to make your new rental business a stunning success. Elevating forks allow for easy placement of picked items onto the pallet, whilst the walk-through version allows the handling of bulky loads, enhancing operator comfort and efficiency.
