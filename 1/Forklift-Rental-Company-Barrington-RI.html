<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.).

Counterbalanced = A lift truck that utilizes weight in its chassis to counterbalance a load against the center line of the drive wheels. Trucks with electric steering include the Active Traction system with innovative hydraulics that adjusts the pressure on the traction tyre depending on loading conditions for faster travel speeds and better traction on ramps.</p>
<p>For example, a forklift with a 10,000-pound (4,540 kg) lift capacity is limited to a maximum lift height of 20 feet (6 m) and a maximum forward reach of 8 feet (2 m) when lifting a full 10,000-pound load.
