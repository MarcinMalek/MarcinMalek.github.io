<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

Every rental truck is prepped by a Raymond certified technician and quality inspected by our shop foreman to make sure that each piece of equipment is ready to work when it reaches your facility.

Some industrial reach forklift trucks have a mechanism allowing its cab to tilt, enabling the operator to have a more convenient position while viewing.</p>
<p>Wang says that Hangcha will continue to invest in rough-terrain R&D, particularly in developing equipment with more tonnage and configurations. Rough terrain poses additional threats and risks to the operators of forklifts. However, suspension lift kits let the truck owners lift their truck as high as they want. They have been renting out equipment for over 50 years.</p>
