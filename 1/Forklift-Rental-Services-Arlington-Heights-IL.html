<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>While most standard forklifts can reach between 10 and 15 feet, a telehandler can lift to heights of 55 feet. As already mentioned, choosing a forklift with the right handling capacity is therefore essential. Forklifts come in a variety of shapes and sizes to do various jobs. You'll often see these forklifts traveling down the highway on the back of semi-truck trailers.</p>
<p>Container handlers are manufactured in many configurations including overhead crane-style handlers, as well as traditional vertical and telescopic mast type forklifts. Come to our location and check out truck brands like Chevy , GMC , Ford , and Ram that have lift kits included. This standard is also intended for voluntary use by others associated with manufacturing or utilizing powered industrial trucks.</p>
