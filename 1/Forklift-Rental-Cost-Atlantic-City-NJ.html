It is suggested that powered industrial trucks be painted a color which will comply with the USA Standard Safety Color Code for Marking Physical Hazards and the Identification of Certain Equipment, Z53.1-1967.</p>
<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>
<p>Hydraulic Pallet Truck is designed with polyurethane rollers that allow the machine to operate easily.
