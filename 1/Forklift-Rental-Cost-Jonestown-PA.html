<p>Toyota Forklift is proud to have the biggest range of forklifts and battery-electric warehouse equipment available in South-Africa, ensuring that whatever your requirements we have a suitable material handling solution.

Layman's Terms: This is a commonly used suspension lift component that does raise the truck, but doesn't add extra ground clearance for the underbelly. Likewise, in current scenarios, the diesel forklift trucks are estimated to have an exponential growth rate over the forecast period ranging from the most simple to the advance manufactured Forklift Trucks that includes electronically controlled engines and GPS communication systems.</p>
<p>While they move heavy loads and increase efficiency, forklifts can also cause serious injuries when they are used unsafely. Those are the vehicles that you will need to test drive before making a decision. OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.178 covering PITs requires employers to develop and implement a training program based on the general principles of safe truck operation.</p>

Many of the most serious forklift accidents happen when a driver drops a payload.</p>
