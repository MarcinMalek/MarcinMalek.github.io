<h2>Lift Truck Companies Milford</h2>
<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>If you're unable to find a pre-made lifted truck in your area, or if these vehicles are too expensive for your budget, you may have more luck modifying a truck yourself. The arm allows the operator flexibility in picking up and placing loads (at various distances and lift heights) from the front of the machine. Load capacities are similar to a standard lift, ranging between 5,000 lbs and 36,000 lbs.</p>

There are other models that have an auxiliary mast that is mounted in front of the platform with pallet forks. We offer a full line of both new and used trucks, buses and trailers. Drive and operate your rental equipment safely.

Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>

We have forklifts that are capable of lifting at 20 feet, and we also rent Harlo and JCB 8,000-pound capacity rough terrain forklifts with the ability to reach up to 28 feet.
