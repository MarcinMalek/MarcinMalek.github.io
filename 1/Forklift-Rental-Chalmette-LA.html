Rough terrain forklifts typically have rugged tyres and feature heavy-duty construction.

<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height for the limit of travel speed, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph C about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
