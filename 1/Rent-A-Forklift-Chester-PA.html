With a complete range of rental plans to choose from, greater flexibility in handling operational peaks and troughs, and predictable costs, rentals can make both commercial and financial sense. A pallet jack, also known as a pallet truck, 1 pallet pump, pump truck, scooter, dog, 1 or jigger 1 is a tool used to lift and move pallets Pallet jacks are the most basic form of a forklift 2 and are intended to move pallets within a warehouse.</p>

<p>Free Lift = The vertical distance the forks can be raised before a mast begins to telescope. The forks, supported by the two front wheels, are raised hydraulically to lift the pallet.

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air.

This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
